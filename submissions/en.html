      <div id="section6" class="accordion-collapse" data-parent="article-content">
        <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Describes the research problem, the point of view from which it will be
          addressed, and the interest of the topic for the area of research, and the reader. The objective of the
          manuscript should be indicated in the final paragraph.</p>
        <p><strong>Materials and methods:</strong> Describes the process that was used to solve the research question.
          It will describe population, sample and types of sample allocation, population characteristics (sex, age),
          as
          well as the type of study and analysis, evaluation methods and instruments used and its validity. Similarly
          should describe the statistical methods with enough detail so that a versed on the subject with access to
          the
          original data, the reader can verify the findings are reported. Specify any computer program, commonly used,
          that has been used.</p>
        <p><strong>Results:</strong> Summarize the results of the study. The use of tables or original figures is
          required to facilitate the presentation and adequate visualization of the data, hence the need for them to
          be
          clear. It is also important to avoid repeating the information that appears in the tables or figures (no
          more
          than four), in the text. It can be written in the present so that the findings are considered scientific
          evidence, or in the past as part of a previously realized process.</p>
        <p><strong>Discussion:</strong> The analysis of the research question in the light of the results should
          should
          be presented in the analysis. How the results were obtained, and if a hypothesis was put forward should be
          explicitly stated whether the results support it or not. The results are compared with those of other
          investigations from primary information sources. Brief improvements to the research itself or to new
          research
          can be suggested briefly. The discussion section addresses the contribution, or contributions, of research
          or
          reflection. It must be written in the present, in order to support the actuality and evidence of the
          results.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> Should coincide with the objectives, results, and discussion. The article
          should present the contributions made by the research, whether in the form of carrying out the processes,
          conceiving the ideas or understanding a situation. Likewise, the limitations of research, and the new
          perspectives created in the field of research, must be made clear.</p>
        <p><strong>Recommendations:</strong> Are optional, and are used in cases where researchers want to emphasize
          the
          limitations and new problems generated with the conclusions drawn.</p>
        <p><strong>Acknowledgments:</strong> If desired, cite people or institutions that have collaborated with the
          research.</p>
        <p><strong>References:</strong> lIst of texts, documents and other works consulted for the construction of the
          document and cited in its body. Must appear at the end of each article, and be numbered in a strict,
          consecutive order (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7256">Normas Vancouver</a>). The
          references
          must be organized with the help of a bibliographic reference manager (<em>Mendeley – EndNote - ZOTERO
            etc.</em>), since any error (additional or deleted spaces, etc.) will prevent the article from being
          properly digitized for publication.</p>
