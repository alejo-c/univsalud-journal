      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Formal analysis:</strong>
        Application of statistical, mathematical, computational, or other formal techniques to analyze or synthesize

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Validation:</strong>
        Verification, whether as a part of the activity or separate, of the overall replication/reproducibility of

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Visualization:</strong>
        Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically visualization/data presentation.
      </li>
