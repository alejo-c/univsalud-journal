    <h2>17 Goals to Transform Our World</h2>
    <p>
      The Sustainable Development Goals are a call for action by all countries – poor, rich and middle-income – to
      promote prosperity while protecting the planet. They recognize that ending poverty must go hand-in-hand with
      strategies that build economic growth and address a range of social needs including education, health, social
      protection, and job opportunities, while tackling climate change and environmental protection.
