      <ul>
        <li>The type of evaluation used by the Journal is “double-blind”, in which the evaluators do not know the
          identity of the author, and the author does not know the identity of the evaluators.</li>
        <li>The Editorial Committee decides if a work is eligible to be published. In addition to complying with the
          scientific quality, the work must also comply with the guidelines and regulations of publication and
          presentation described above.</li>
        <li>In the first review, the author can be asked to make clarifications or adjustments before proceeding with
          the evaluation process.</li>
        <li>The Journal reserves the right to reject articles that do not comply with the conditions established for
          publication.</li>
        <li>The editorial team assigns submissions to external reviewers with research expertise, publications on the
          evaluated subject, and no conflicts of interest.</li>
        <li>- Reviewers and referees must complete an evaluation form; the journal provides a certificate for their
          participation.</li>
        <li>
          <p>Once the verdicts emitted by both judges are available, the possible results of this stage can be:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Acceptance of the article.</li>
            <li>Acceptance with corrections.</li>
            <li>Rejection.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To settle cases of controversy, an evaluation by a third judge may be used. This phase of the process may
            take 4 months.</p>
        </li>
        <li>The concepts of the evaluators will be returned to the author of correspondence for any modifications,
          depending on the case.</li>
        <li>After making the requested changes, the article will be returned by the authors to the journal accompanied
          by a letter specifying punctually the corrections made and/or justifying the non-completion of the
          observations that were not accepted, arguing them with the pertinent bibliographic references. In addition,
          the document should highlight the changes made.</li>
        <li>The Editorial Committee will verify compliance with the recommendations given by the evaluators and
          determine the feasibility of publication. At this point in time, the article may be returned to the author
          for additional modifications, which, if not accepted, will result in the article not being published.</li>
        <li>The Journal reserves the right to select the articles that are published in each volume.</li>
        <li>To comply with international standards, a maximum of two articles published by the author in a single
          volume is allowed.</li>
        <li>Once the publication has been approved by the Editorial Committee, the editing of style, layout, and final
          adjustments will follow. This document will be sent to the authors for general review, and will return it
          within 48 hours, attaching observations that they consider pertinent or certifying to be in agreement with
          the final version.</li>
        <li>If the article is written in English or Portuguese, the authors must attach an official translation
          certification in the English language of the abstract and keywords.</li>
        <li>The manuscript rejection rate following review is 22%.</li>
        <li>The period from submission to acceptance may take up to 9 months.</li>

      <h4>ORCID</h4>
      <p>The journal requests that researchers use persistent identifiers such as <a href="https://orcid.org/">ORCID</a>
        for author profiles, which serve as a tool for increasing the visibility
        of academic production, as well as providing information on affiliation, area of expertise, contact, and
        publications.</p>
      <h4>Datasets</h4>
      <p>Datasets are collections of data, frequently tabulated, that can serve as databases to detail the findings or
        origin of the results mentioned in the manuscript.</p>
      <p>When submitting a research manuscript, authors are asked to upload the data that supports the findings
        reported in the document. This is intended to allow readers, reviewers, and editors to review and access the
        data, thus promoting transparency in the publication and increasing the likelihood of citation by other
        researchers interested in using them. The types of files that can be linked to the dataset include plain text,
        Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PDF files, HTML content, videos, and images.</p>
      <p>It is recommended to use appropriate public repositories for datasets, ensuring the protection of study
        participants' confidentiality by removing personally identifiable data (anonymization), and ensuring that the
        documents are not password-protected. The dataset can be created and published in any repository, but the
        journal recommends using the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mendeley Data: <a href="https://data.mendeley.com">https://data.mendeley.com</a>.</li>

      </ul>
      <h4>Preprints</h4>
      <p>Preprints are articles deposited by authors in a public server, which have a methodological structure but
        have not been peer-reviewed.</p>
      <p>If you wish to submit your manuscript to the Journal, but it is published in a server or public repository of
        preprints, or in an institutional virtual library, it is mandatory to inform it in the <a
          href="https://revistas.udenar.edu.co/index.php/usalud/libraryFiles/downloadPublic/268"> cover letter </a> at
        the beginning of the editorial process. Unless the manuscript is removed from these spaces before the peer

    <div id="section12" class="accordion-collapse" data-parent="history">
      <p>The journal was created in 2000 with the aim of publishing manuscripts derived from research conducted by
        students of the Master’s in Nursing program, offered through an agreement between the Center for Health
        Studies at the University of Nariño and the University of Valle. The journal initially had an annual
        publication frequency.</p>
      <p>Since 2003, the journal has participated in the scientific journal evaluation call by IBN-Publindex from the
        Ministry of Science and Technology, progressively improving its rankings in different categories: 2003–2009:
        C; 2010: B; 2013–2014: A2; 2017–2020: C; 2021: B.</p>
      <p>Until 2015 it had a biannual print edition frequency; in 2016, it became a quarterly online version with
        three issues per year (January–April, May–August, September–December).</p>
