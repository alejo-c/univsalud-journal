      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>
          <strong>1.1 References and plagiarism.</strong>
          The author(s) is responsible for the accuracy of the content and citation of all references, in order to
          ensure that the article and the materials associated with it are original or do not infringe copyright.
          <strong>Plagiarism is absolutely prohibited</strong>
          and therefore, articles identified as plagiarized, during or after the editorial process, will be removed from
          the journal (regardless of whether they have already been published). Excessive self-citation is also
          considered a bad practice.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>1.2 Evaluation of articles.</strong>
          Each article will be evaluated by the "<strong>peer review</strong>" method to determine its technical
          quality, originality, scientific contribution, among other relevant criteria. Peer review is governed by the
          “<strong>blinded experiment</strong>” method to ensure an evaluation process that is free from bias or
          conflict of interest. Final opinions, or approval, will be issued by the Editorial Committee of Rev. Univ.
          Salud. This implies that the article can not be replaced or withdrawn during the evaluation process if it is
          recommended for publication.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>1.3 Selection of articles.</strong>
          Members of the journal editorial committee will select articles from the list of eligibles according to
          eligibility criteria. The selection sessions will be chaired by the director of the journal, to be legal the
          quorum will be composed of half plus one of its members.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>1.4 Confidentiality.</strong>
          The editorial team, and the evaluators, commit to not disclose any information about any article submitted to
          the journal, aside from the participants themselves during the selection process of the articles.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>1.5 Article duplication or concurrence.</strong>
          The submission of a manuscript to the journal implies that the author agrees with the evaluation method that
          will be applied to the article, declares that the article has not been sent for evaluation or published to
          another journal, and confirms that the article is not in the process of publication in another journal. For
          this reason, the author(s) agrees not to send the article to another journal while waiting for the evaluation
          report. In this case, the submission will be eliminated.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>1.6 Acknowledgement.</strong>
          The recognition of financial sponsors for research will be indicated in an exclusive section, and will be
          respected in the publication.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>1.7 Publication of Retractions and Manifestations of Concern.</strong>
          The procedures followed by the journal for the recording and publication of withdrawals and expressions of
          concern are based on the
          <a href="https://publicationethics.org/about/what-we-do/our-story/core-practices">
            Guidelines on Best Practices for Publications
          </a>
          and the
          <a href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance/guideline/retraction-guidelines">
            Retraction Guidelines
          </a>
          defined by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) for Scientific Journal Editors. Retraction is a public
          instrument used to register and/or correct problems of a published article or to communicate its cancellation,
          and is an integral part of the scientific communication system. When an author discovers a serious error in
          their work, they have the obligation to communicate it to those responsible for the journal as
          <strong>soon as possible</strong> in order to modify the error, retract it, publish a correction or errata. If
          a potential error is detected by any of the editorial team members, authors are required to defend their work,
          and prove that it is correct.
        </p>

        <p>
          The procedure for recording an article's retraction begins after receiving formal communication of the author
          or researcher, requesting the retraction or manifestation of concern of the published article. The
          communication must be accompanied by the argument for retraction of the article. The retracted article will
          not be deleted from the volume where it was originally published. In the electronic version, a published
          message of the justification sent by the publisher will appear. The original PDF will be retained, but the
          retraction text added before the original full text, and watermark will prevent it from being read, or will
          make it difficult to read.

          <strong>2.1 Article selection agreements.</strong>
          In the case of plagiarism or fraudulent information the Editor and the Editorial Committee will be guided by
          the publication policies of the journal, in order to maintain the quality of the journal, ensuring compliance
          with universal ethical principles in published articles. They will also be responsible for the selection of
          the articles, based on the following criteria:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Originality of the work.</li>
          <li>Relevance of the article.</li>
          <li>Quality of the article.</li>
          <li>Presentation, writing, and clarity of the article structure.</li>
          <li>
            In no case will race, gender, sexual orientation, belief, origin, citizenship, academic affiliation,
            business or political orientation of the author(s) be taken into consideration.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>2.2 Revision of articles.</strong>
          Ensure the confidentiality of authors and reviewers, guaranteeing compliance with the double-blind method.
          Follow up on evaluators’ comments to prevent overly rigorous or offensive evaluations of the authors. They may
          also propose modifications to the articles, based on the comments of the evaluators, or directives. It should
          be noted an article that they could rejected without submitting it to peer review if it does not meet the
          guidelines dictated by the directive or is incomplete.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2.3 Conflict of interest.</strong>
          The Editor and members of the Editorial Committee will refrain from participating in evaluations, publishing,
          and any editorial process that includes articles with which they may have a conflict of interest due to their
          academic relationship, or affiliation, with any of the authors. Confidentiality is maintained before any
          clarifications, claims, or complaints that the author(s) may wish to submit to the Editorial Committee of the
          journal.
